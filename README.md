React External Window
=====================

With **React External Window** you can render React components in an external child window from within an app. 

_Works with redux-connected components!_



## Installation

**Requires React v16** and assumes youâ€™re using _npm_ package manager with a module bundler like _Webpack_ or _Browserify_ to consume _CommonJS_ modules.
```
npm i --save react-external-window
```



## Usage

A `Window` component accepts the following props. For more information, visit [MDN's documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/open) on `window.open`.

| Prop Name | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `url` | Do not provide one if you want to render the `children` provided to `Window` | `Empty String` |
| `title` | Title to display in title bar | `'Untitled'` |
| `name` | Name passed to `window.open` |
| `y` | Maps to `top` property of `windowFeatures` | `0` |
| `x` | Maps to `left` poperty of `windowFeatures` | `0` |
| `width` | Initial width in pixels of child window |
| `height` | Initial height in pixels of child window |
| `menubar` | Show menubar on child window. Acceptable values are `1`/`0`, `yes`/`no` | `0` |
| `scrollbars` | Show scrollbars on child window. Acceptable values are `1`/`0`, `yes`/`no` | `1` |
| `status` | Show status bar on child window. Acceptable values are `1`/`0`, `yes`/`no` | `0` |
| `toolbar` | Show toolbar on child window. Acceptable values are `1`/`0`, `yes`/`no` | `0` |
| `titlebar` | Show menubar on child window. Acceptable values are `1`/`0`, `yes`/`no` | `0` |
| `onLoad` | Passed reference to newly created window |
| `onClose` | Passed reference to closing window, useful for saving properties like position or size |
| `onBlock` | Calling `window.open` fails, usually due to a popup blocker |

![Parts of a Child Window](https://developer.mozilla.org/@api/deki/files/210/=FirefoxChromeToolbarsDescription7a.gif)

**React External Window** can have be supplied `children` or a `function`, which is passed the external window instance.

``` jsx
<Window 
    url=''
    title='My Window'
>
    //...children
</Window>
```

Using `this.props.children` as a render prop:
``` jsx
<Window 
    url=''
    title='My Window'
>
{(window) => (
    // ...children to render
    <button onClick={() => window.close()}>Close!</button>
)}
</Window>
```
Having access to the external window instance allows methods to be called on the external window instead of the parent window. In the example above calling `window.close()` without access to the instance would call `close` on the parent window, which is not allowed so nothing would happen.



## Example

Say you have an app that has some data visualizations, among them a component called `SweetChart`. You want users to see and interact with this `SweetChart` while also carrying out other tasks. With **React External Window** the `SweetChart` (probably a redux-connected component) can live in an external window without the need to load your entire site (or any site) into it.

``` jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import { connect } from 'react-redux';
import Window from 'react-external-window';
import { actionTypes } from './reducer';
import SweetChart from './SweetChart';


class App extends Component {
    onOpenBtnClick = () => {
        this.props.onOpenBtnClick();
    }

    render() {
        return (
            <div>
                <SweetChart />
                <button onClick={this.onOpenBtnClick}>Open!</button>
                <div>{this.props.message}</div>
                {this.props.openWindow &&
                    <Window 
                        url=''
                        title='My Window'
                        name='child'
                        onClose={this.props.onCloseWindow}
                    >
                    {(window) => (
                        <React.Fragment>
                            <SweetChart />
                            <button onClick={() => window.close()}>Close!</button>
                        </React.Fragment>
                    )}
                    </Window>
                }
            </div>
        );
    } 
}

const mapStateToProps = (state) => ({
    openWindow: state.openWindow,
    message: state.message,
});

const mapDispatchToProps = (dispatch) => ({
    onOpenBtnClick: () => dispatch({ type: actionTypes.OPEN_WINDOW }),
    onCloseWindow: (window) => dispatch({ type: actionTypes.CLOSE_WINDOW, payload: window }), // save some info about the window instance to use when opening next time
});

export default connect(mapStateToProps, mapDispatchToProps)(App);
```
